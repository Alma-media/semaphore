Running Semaphore is pretty simple. The daemon by default spawns a production-ready broker. The Semaphore daemon is stateless and multiple instances could be run at the same time to provide scalability.

## Service hosts

Services could have different hosts when running Maestro in multiple environments. Service configurations could be overridden through service selectors. It is advised to store your service selectors inside a separate file and use an environment variable to include a specific service configuration.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="config"
  values={[
    { label: 'config.hcl', value: 'config', },
    { label: 'services.production.hcl', value: 'services', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="config">

```hcl
include = ["services.$ENVIRONMENT.hcl"]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="services">

```hcl
services {
    select "org.users.*" {
        host = "users.ns.svc.com"
    }

    select "org.projects.*" {
        host = "projects.ns.svc.com"
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Service certificates

Root certificates could be included to provide secure connections. Certificates could be passed as options or be overridden through service selectors.

```hcl
services {
    select "com.org.users.*" {
			host = "api.semaphore.io"
			insecure = "false"
			ca_file = "/etc/ca.crt"
    }

    select "com.org.projects.*" {
      host = "insecure-api.semaphore.io"
			insecure = "true"
    }
}
```

## Prometheus

A Prometheus metrics endpoint could be set-up. This endpoint exposes metrics such as flow executions, executed rollbacks, and flow latency. The Prometheus agent starts its own HTTP server and requires a separate port.

```hcl
prometheus {
    address = ":5050"
}
```
