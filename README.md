Maestro is a tool to orchestrate requests inside your microservice architecture.
A request could be manipulated passed branched to different services to be returned as a single output.

The key features of Maestro are:

* **Call branching**: All calls within a flow are executed [concurrently](https://github.com/jexia/maestro/tree/master/flow) from one another. Dependencies between calls are created through references or when specified.

* **SAGA patterns**: Rollbacks are easily implemented and automatically executed when an unexpected error is thrown during execution. Rollbacks could reference data received from other services.

## Getting started

1. [‚ö° CLI](https://github.com/jexia/maestro/tree/master/cmd/maestro)
1. [üöÄ Examples](https://github.com/jexia/maestro/tree/master/examples)
1. [üìö Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/jexia/maestro)

You could download the CLI from source or most commonly used package managers. Or pull one of the available docker images.

```bash
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/jexia/maestro/cli:latest
```

---

All data streams inside Maestro are called flows.
A flow can manipulate, deconstruct and forwarded data in between calls and services.
Flows are exposed through endpoints. Flows are generic and could handle different transports and codecs within a single flow.
All flows are strictly typed through schema definitions. These schemas define the contracts provided and accepted by services.

```hcl
endpoint "checkout" "http" {
    method = "POST"
    endpoint = "/checkout"
    codec = "json"
}

endpoint "checkout" "graphql" {
    path = "data"
}

flow "checkout" {
    input "schema.Object" {
    }

    resource "shipping" {
        request "package.warehouse" "Send" {
            user = "{{ input:id }}"
        }
    }

    output "schema.Object" {
        status = "{{ shipping:status }}"
    }
}
```
